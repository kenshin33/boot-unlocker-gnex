This application **REQUIRES** a Galaxy Nexus (_maguro_, _toro_ or _toroplus_), Nexus 4 (_mako_),

You've rooted your device,
and you are trying to decide between the security of relocking
your bootloader (with stock recovery and USB Debugging off), and the flexibility
of leaving it unlocked.

You know that in order to prevent an unauthorized user from accessing your data by
flashing a custom recovery, `fastboot oem unlock` wipes your data.
This also means that if you relock your bootloader, you will need to do a full
backup-and-restore whenever you decide to unlock it again.

_BootUnlocker for Nexus Devices_ lets you have the best of both worlds by using root
privileges to unlock your bootloader from within Android, without wiping your data.
This allows you to keep your bootloader locked for security, with this application
safely protected behind your lockscreen password.  Whenever you want to unlock or
relock your bootloader, just unlock your screen and run _BootUnlocker_.
